  <p><b>High-demand job</b> typically means that either there are more opportunities than qualified candidates
    to fill them, or that there will be more jobs available over the next several years. These types of jobs tend to
    have several benefits, including more competitive salaries, increased opportunities for advancement, and in some
    instances, even greater job security.</p>
  <p> The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has estimated the job growth rate over the next decade for 324
    occupations in the United States. Based on that projected data, we’ve compiled a list of 12 in-demand jobs that
    exceed the average growth rate of 9 percent and may be worth considering as you look for your next role. </p>

    software and tools without interruption. In addition to developing short-term and long-term system plans,

    or finance, in order to convey the necessary information accurately.</p>
